<h1>The Best Movies According to Surina</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<H3>Inception</H3>
<p> This is my favourite science-fiction thriller. Christopher Nolan directed this film. He is a prodigious director who also directed the Batman trilogy. </p>

<H3>Memoirs of a Geisha</H3>
<p> This film tells the story of a Geisha in pre world-war 2 Japan. It's a compelling, yet heartwrenching story. </p>

<H3>The Sound of Music</H3>
<p> This an old, classic film with a beautiful story and music that makes you simply want to sing along in pure enjoyment.  </p>
